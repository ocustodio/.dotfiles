# .dotfiles

welcome to my dotfiles repository! I'm running Arch Linux with Hyprland, a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor, to create a lightweight, efficient, and visually appealing desktop environment.  

this repo contains my custom configurations for hyprland, waybar, kitty and other tools.  

i stopped using i3, but there is a config for it too.  

it's a very, very simple configa and rice, kinda minimalistic, but I like it very much! feel free to copy it and improve it the way it fits you the most.  

i'm constantly updating it, so I hope to remember to change the screenshots eventually.  

## screenshots
the wallpaper is from this [repo](https://github.com/pollux78/linuxnext-wallpapers). there is so many incredible ones, check it out! (i don't know the artist from the wallpaper that I'm using, but I know is from the game marathon).
